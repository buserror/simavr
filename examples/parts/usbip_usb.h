	usbip_usb.h

	USB/IP server for the simavr USB device model.

	The simulated AVR is exported as a USB/IP device, so that a USB/IP
	client attaches it to the host's USB stack, e.g. on Linux, with the
	mainline vhci-hcd driver:

		modprobe vhci-hcd
		usbip list -r 127.0.0.1
		usbip attach -r 127.0.0.1 -b 1-1

	Everything runs in the simulation thread, from a cycle timer.

 * This is a generic i2c eeprom; it can be up to 4096 bytes, and can work
 * in two modes :
 * 1) ONE slave address, and either one or two bytes sent on i2c to specify
 *    the byte to read/write.
 *    So a transaction looks like:
 *    <i2c address> [<byte offset MSB>] <byte offset LSB> [<data>]
 * 2) Multiple slave address to specify the high byte offset value, and one
 *    byte offset sent
 *    So a transaction looks like:
 *    <i2c address; x low bits used as byte offset> <byte offset LSB> [<data>]
 *
 * these two modes seem to cover many eeproms

 * Initializes an eeprom.
 *
 * The address is the TWI/i2c address base, for example 0xa0 -- the 7 MSB are
 * relevant, the bit zero is always meant as the "read write" bit.
 * The "mask" parameter specifies which bits should be matched as a slave;
 * if you want to have a peripheral that handle read and write, use '1'; if you
 * want to also match several addresses on the bus, specify these bits on the
 * mask too.
 * Example:
 * Address 0xa1 mask 0x00 will match address 0xa0 in READ only
 * Address 0xa0 mask 0x01 will match address 0xa0 in read AND write mode
 * Address 0xa0 mask 0x03 will match 0xa0 0xa2 in read and write mode
 *
 * The "data" is optional, data is initialized as 0xff like a normal eeprom.

This contains a sample program to demonstrate the use of simavr
using 'custom' code, and own "peripherals". It shows how it is
possible to "hook" code to the AVR pins, and also how to make
"peripherals" and also hook them up to AVR pins.

This demo demonstrate how to write a i2c/twi "peripheral" and hook it to
an AVR, and then run a firmware that behaves as a TWI "master" to talk to it.

The code uses a generic i2c "eeprom" were the AVR writes some bytes,
then read them again. The AVR code is based on the Atmel reference
implementation, with quite a few changes to make it more functional.

Thid "board" doesn't use opengl, the eeprom will display what the
transactions are.

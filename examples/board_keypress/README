This contains a sample program to demonstrate the use of simavr
using 'custom' code, and own "peripherals". It shows how it is
possible to "hook" code to the AVR pins, and also how to make
"peripherals" and also hook them up to AVR pins.

The demo will display two LEDs, one connected to the PORTB5 pin
and second to the PORTD7 pin of the mega48.
Two other pins, PORTD0 and PORTD1, are configured as internally
pulled-up inputs and push buttons are hooked-up to them.

Firmware transfers the state of every input pin to corresponding
output pin in a loop. The state of PORTD0 pin is copied to the PORTB5
and PORTD1 is copied to PORTD7.

On startup, both LEDs should lit, this demonstrates a wark of internall pull-ups.
If you hit '1' key on the keyboard, PORTD0 and PORTB5 should go into LOW state 
and the LED will be turned off.
On '2' key hit the same will happen with the second LED.


The display uses opengl and "glut" so it should be very portable.
On most linux you will need "freeglut-dev" package.

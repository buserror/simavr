With thanks to Luki <humbell@ethz.ch>

This sample code is derivated from a patch sent by Luki, however it was mostly
in german, and was using the SDL library. Also the implementation of the LCD
itself had several shortcomings.

Therefore it was almost entirely rewritten from scratch the LCD was extended
and made as compliant as it is practical, and the sample code itself was
stripped of SDL. Also the german AVR LCD driver was replaced with the 
avr-libc one, a much more complete one.

This example demonstrated how to write a "part' that provide both a way to
visualize what your code is doing, but also provide extra data you can
visualize in gtkwave; so the LCD "part" exports quite a few IRQs that can
be used to help you trace and debug your own code.

Make sure to run this program and visualize the pretty curves.

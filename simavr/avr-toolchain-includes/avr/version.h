/** \defgroup avr_version <avr/version.h>: avr-libc version macros
    \code #include <avr/version.h> \endcode

    This header file defines macros that contain version numbers and
    strings describing the current version of avr-libc.

    The version number itself basically consists of three pieces that
    are separated by a dot: the major number, the minor number, and
    the revision number.  For development versions (which use an odd
    minor number), the string representation additionally gets the
    date code (YYYYMMDD) appended.

    This file will also be included by \c <avr/io.h>.  That way,
    portable tests can be implemented using \c <avr/io.h> that can be
    used in code that wants to remain backwards-compatible to library
    versions prior to the date when the library version API had been
    added, as referenced but undefined C preprocessor macros
    automatically evaluate to 0.

    In the numerical representation, the major number is multiplied by

    added.  It is intented to provide a monotonically increasing
    numerical value that can easily be used in numerical checks.

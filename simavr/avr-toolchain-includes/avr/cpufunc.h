   debugging purposes, a NOP can be useful to have an instruction that

   Implement a read/write <i>memory barrier</i>.  A memory
   barrier instructs the compiler to not cache any memory data in
   registers beyond the barrier.  This can sometimes be more effective
   than blocking certain optimizations by declaring some object with a
   \c volatile qualifier.

   See \ref optim_code_reorder for things to be taken into account
   with respect to compiler optimizations.

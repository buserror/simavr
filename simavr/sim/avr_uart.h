/*
 * The method of "connecting" the the UART from external code is to use 4 IRQS.
 * The easy one is UART->YOU, where you will be called with the byte every time
 * the AVR firmware sends one. Do whatever you like with it.
 *
 * The slightly more tricky one is the INPUT part. Since the AVR is quite a bit
 * slower than your code most likely, there is a way for the AVR UART to tell
 * you to "pause" sending it bytes when its own input buffer is full.
 * So, the UART will send XON to you when its fifo is empty, XON means you can
 * send as many bytes as you have until XOFF is sent. Note that these are two
 * IRQs because you /will/ be called with XOFF when sending a byte in INPUT...
 * So it's a reentrant process.
 *
 * When XOFF has been called, do not send any new bytes, they would be dropped.
 * Instead wait for XON again and continue.
 * See examples/parts/uart_udp.c for a full implementation
 *
 * Pseudo code:
 *
 * volatile int off = 0;
 * void irq_xon()
 * {
 *     off = 0;
 *     while (!off && bytes_left)
 *     avr_raise_irq(UART_IRQ_INPUT, a_byte);
 * }
 * void irq_xoff()
 * {
 *     off = 1;
 * }
